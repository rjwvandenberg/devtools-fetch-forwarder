Use a browser's devtools to capture requests and forward them to a webserver with a post request.

## Usage
Edit manifest.json with the URL of a website you want to forward requests from.  
Edit devtools.js to change what you want to forward.  
Add the extension to your browser and enable it.  
Open devtools in your browser, then visit the website you want to forward.  
Request will now arrive at http://locahost/ingest.
